Customer Retention & Churn Analysis

Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics | Task 2 (2026)

1. Overview

This analysis evaluates customer churn patterns across subscription types, regions, and tenure groups. The goal is to identify high-risk segments and recommend actions to improve retention and long-term revenue stability.

2. Key Metrics

Total Customers: 1000

Active Customers: 806

Churned Customers: 194

Overall Churn Rate: 19.4%

The company is losing nearly 1 in 5 customers, indicating moderate retention risk.

3. Key Findings
A. Churn by Subscription Type

Premium subscription shows the highest churn rate.

This suggests higher expectations from premium users that may not be fully met.

Potential dissatisfaction may stem from pricing, service value, or feature gaps.

B. Regional Churn Patterns

East region has the highest churn rate.

Indicates possible regional service quality, competition, or customer behavior issues.

Regional marketing and customer support strategies should be evaluated.

C. Tenure vs Churn

Customers with low tenure (0–6 months) show the highest churn.

Churn significantly decreases as tenure increases.

Early-stage onboarding and engagement appear to be weak.

This suggests first-month experience is critical.

D. Revenue Impact

Active customers generate the majority of total revenue.

Average revenue per churned customer is slightly lower than active customers.

Churn is driven more by volume than high-value customer loss.

4. Key Business Risks

Weak onboarding process for new customers.

Premium plan retention issues.

Regional instability in East zone.

Risk of compounding churn if early-stage experience remains poor.

5. Recommendations
1. Improve Early Onboarding

Introduce welcome emails, guided tutorials, and 30-day engagement campaigns.

Offer limited-time onboarding incentives.

2. Review Premium Plan Value

Evaluate feature-to-price ratio.

Conduct customer feedback surveys specifically for Premium users.

3. Regional Strategy for East

Analyze regional competition.

Improve targeted marketing campaigns.

Review support response times.

4. Retention Tracking Dashboard

Monitor churn weekly.

Track churn by tenure bucket continuously.

Flag high-risk segments proactively.

6. Conclusion

Customer churn is primarily driven by early-stage disengagement and premium subscription instability. Strategic focus on onboarding improvements and premium value optimization can significantly reduce churn and stabilize long-term revenue growth.
